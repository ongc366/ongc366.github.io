                        <p class = 'essay'>
                            To a portion 
                            of the city&#8217;s immigrant population, Chinatown seems 
                            like a home away from home&#8212;a place where one could have 
                            the opportunity to reinvent under the watchful guidance 
                            of their peers and away from the inklings of discrimination 
                            existing beyond its borders. At the forefront of this 
                            largely, self-supporting, comunity&#8217;s growth is an internal 
                            structure of family associations and community organizations 
                            that each serve to provide &#8220;jobs, economic aid, social 
                            service, and protection [A].&#8221; Similarly, provisions for the 
                            community can also extend to the citizens themselves as 
                            they are driven to create businesses that serves not to 
                            satisfy the populous, but the residents of Chinatown. 
                            It is through this patchwork-like proliferation of mom 
                            and pop variety stores, peking duck restaurants, and 
                            herbal shops, that the pursuit has come to life and has now 
                            become part of a widespread vision of the area that even 
                            transcends state boundaries.

                            However with negotiations against new zoning regulations 
                            gone awry, the exact definition of Chinatown seems to be 
                            shifting. Evictions and rising rents are beginning to cast a 
                            shadow on the neighborhood in the form of &#8220;big property 
                            values [of] little character [B].&#8221; Proposed rezoning regulations 
                            offer a way to fight this shift, but the follow-through of 
                            such an initiative on behalf of the community is often shaky. 
                            What then becomes of local vendors and affordable housing?

                            The rise of cultural preservation in 
                            the conversation of development is driving a new way to look 
                            at changing Chinatown for the better. Rooted in the idea of 
                            preservation is the notion of informed policy especially in 
                            areas where associations who still own whole buildings full of 
                            overseas residents. Further rooted in the idea of informed 
                            policy is the notion of ethnic bonds which are primary in 
                            setting the area apart from an enclave and into a home. It is 
                            the hope of many that those who have to means to exact on big 
                            decisions have this in their minds as contracts are being signed. 
                            Having to start over is hard enough, but having to start over 
                            again is even harder.

                            families have sought real estate in outer boroughs (particularly
