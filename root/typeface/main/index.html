                        To a portion 
                        of the city&#8217;s immigrant population, Chinatown seems 
                        like a home away from home&#8212;a place where one could have 
                        the opportunity to reinvent under the watchful guidance 
                        of their peers and away from the inklings of discrimination 
                        existing beyond its borders. At the forefront of this 
                        largely, self-supporting, comunity&#8217;s growth is an internal 
                        structure of family associations and community organizations 
                        that each serve to provide &#8220;jobs, economic aid, social 
                        service, and protection <a class = 'resourceLinkExternal' href = '#bibliographyList'>[A]</a>.&#8221; Similarly, provisions for the 
                        community can also extend to the citizens themselves as 
                        they are driven to create businesses that serves not to 
                        satisfy the populous, but the residents of Chinatown. 
                        It is through this patchwork-like proliferation of mom 
                        and pop variety stores, peking duck restaurants, and 
                        herbal shops, that the pursuit has come to life and has now 
                        become part of a widespread vision of the area that even 
                        transcends state boundaries.

                        However with negotiations against new zoning regulations 
                        gone awry, the exact definition of Chinatown seems to be 
                        shifting. Evictions and rising rents are beginning to cast a 
                        shadow on the neighborhood in the form of &#8220;big property 
                        values [of] little character <a class = 'resourceLinkExternal' href = '#bibliographyList'>[B]</a>.&#8221; Proposed rezoning regulations 
                        offer a way to fight this shift, but the follow-through of 
                        such an initiative on behalf of the community is often shaky. 
                        What then becomes of local vendors and affordable housing?

                        The rise of cultural preservation in 
                        the conversation of development is driving a new way to look 
                        at changing Chinatown for the better. Rooted in the idea of 
                        preservation is the notion of informed policy especially in 
                        areas where associations who still own whole buildings full of 
                        overseas residents. Further rooted in the idea of informed 
                        policy is the notion of ethnic bonds which are primary in 
                        setting the area apart from an enclave and into a home. It is 
                        the hope of many that those who have to means to exact on big 
                        decisions have this in their minds as contracts are being signed. 
                        Having to start over is hard enough, but having to start over 
                        again is even harder.

                        ...it&#8217;s a subtle indication of a trend: As so many immigrants&#8217;

                        families have sought real estate in outer boroughs (particularly
