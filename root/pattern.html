    <h2>Bartow-Pell Mansion Museum</h2>
    <h3>895 Shore Road</h3>
    <h3>Pelham Bay Park</h3>
    <h6>(718) 885-1461</h6>
    <p>
      Nestled deep in the woods of Pelham Bay Park and only a mile from a
      network of bustling highways in the Bronx, the Bartow-Pell Mansion
      Museum is a rare example of country elegance in New York City. The
      Greek Revival house, originally occupied by publisher Robert Bartow
      and family in 1842, sits on an estate that dates back to 1654 when
      Thomas Pell, an English doctor from Connecticut, bought the land from the
      Siwanoy Indians. The property was acquired by the City in 1888, and the mansion
      was used by Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia as a summer office in 1936. It opened as a museum in 1946.
