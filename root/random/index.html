                        To be honest, I think the whole concept of
                        speed dating is really pretty silly. I mean does it really take the same 
                        amount of time to brew a cup of coffee as it does to
                        find the love of your life? But, there must be a reason
                        why it still very much a part of dating today. Perhaps, 
                        it is something beyond what science can explain, 
                        instead going into what science can create?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I realize now that what is really quite 
                        amazing about speed dating is the amount of trust 
                        and spontaneity put into the actual effort of finding. Although 
                        the one across the table from you may not be the love of your
                        life, he or she is a reflection of your own vulnerability. <scpan class = 'underline'>Of innocence, 
                        giving up onself to fate, and the fun that comes with
                        actualizing on hope</scpan> (woah, I'm going to have to underline that one.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As an ode to the spirit of speed dating, I have decided to 
                        show different vignettes of pretend dates. In each of these vignettes,
                        there is a couple engaging in a little Q/A. <br />Each Q/A conversation
                        is randomly separated in half. As the user pieces the conversation together
                        by cycling through the program, the user is placed under the spontaneity that
                        <br />comes with trust and the hope that comes with finding the one's other half.
