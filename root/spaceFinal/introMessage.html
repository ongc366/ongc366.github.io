                <h1>A project about DAYDREAMING at a BUS STOP while IN TRANSIT.</h1>
                <scpan>But why?</scpan>
                <p>Each image of a shadow shown in this program represents a 
                time period of waiting in the bus stop. <img src = 'waiting.jpg' width= '155px'/>Shadows were chosen to represent 
                a dream-like quality in a space where waiting prompts daydreaming. Although these daydreams are derived from real concepts, 
                they may be recreated by the mind in an unrealistic manner as it tangles itself with more subconscious thoughts.
                <img src = 'interior/assets/shadow1.jpg' width = '155px'/>
                Therefore when the button is pressed in the second state and a recreation of the daydream is prompted, that 
                illustrated vignette of waiting is seen and understood in layers.</p>
