          <h3 class = 'buttonBartow'>Bartow-Pell Mansion Museum</h3>
            <p class = 'infoBartow'>
              Nestled deep in the woods of Pelham Bay Park and only a mile from a
              network of bustling highways in the Bronx, the <mark>Bartow-Pell Mansion
              Museum</mark> is a rare example of country elegance in New York City. The
              Greek Revival house, originally occupied by publisher Robert Bartow
              and family in 1842, sits on an estate that dates back to 1654 when
              Thomas Pell, an English doctor from Connecticut, bought the land from
              the Siwanoy Indians. The property was acquired by the City in 1888,
              and the mansion was used by Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia as a summer office
              in 1936. It opened as a museum in 1946.

          <h3 class = 'buttonEdgar'>Edgar Allan Poe Cottage</h3>
          <p class = 'infoEdgar'>
            The <mark>tiny Poe cottage</mark> in the Bronx, built by John Wheeler in 1812, was the
            last home of Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849), the great American poet and
            author. Set in a small park on the Grand Concourse, it is the only house
            left from the old village of Fordham. Poe leased the one-and-a-half-story
            cottage for $100 a year and wrote many of his classic works there including
            "The Bells," "Eureka" and "Annabel Lee." The cottage, saved from destruction
            in the 1890s by the Shakespeare Society and moved from its original location
            on the other side of Kingsbridge Road in 1913, preserves a precious chapter
            of New York's literary heritage.

        <h3 class = 'buttonLefferts'>Lefferts Historic House</h3>
        <p class = 'infoLefferts'>
          Located six blocks north of its original site on Flatbush Avenue
          near Maple Street, <mark>Lefferts Historic House</mark> in Prospect Park is one
          of the few surviving Dutch Colonial farmhouses in Brooklyn. Pieter
          Lefferts owned the house when it was built between 1777 and 1783 to
          replace an earlier family home burned during the battle of Long Island
          in 1776, and it served as home to at least three more generations of
          the Lefferts family, including his State Senator son John Lefferts and
          his granddaughter. In 1917, the estate of John Lefferts offered the
          House to the City of New York, and in 1920, it was opened as a museum
          by the Fort Greene chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution.

        <h3 class = 'buttonValentine'>Valentine-Varian House</h3>
        <p class = 'infoValentine'>
          The second oldest house in the Bronx, the <mark>Valentine-Varian House</mark> was built
          by blacksmith and farmer Isaac Valentine in 1758, a time when carriages
          traveled the nearby Boston Post Road through a Bronx that was still mostly
          farmland. During the Revolutionary War, Valentine and his family had to
          abandon their two-story fieldstone home, which was occupied by British,
          Hessian, and American troops. Though close to several fierce battles with
          cannons clustered on a nearby hill, the house miraculously survived. In
          1965, the house was donated to The Bronx County Historical Society, moved
          diagonally across the street to its present location on a new foundation,
          and now operates as the Museum of Bronx History.
