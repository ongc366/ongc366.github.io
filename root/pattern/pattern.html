          Nestled deep in the woods of Pelham Bay Park and only a mile from a 
          network of bustling highways in the Bronx, the Bartow-Pell Mansion 
          Museum is a rare example of country elegance in New York City. The 
          Greek Revival house, originally occupied by publisher Robert Bartow 
          and family in 1842, sits on an estate that dates back to 1654 when 
          Thomas Pell, an English doctor from Connecticut, bought the land from 
          the Siwanoy Indians. The property was acquired by the City in 1888, 
          and the mansion was used by Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia as a summer office 
          in 1936. It opened as a museum in 1946.
