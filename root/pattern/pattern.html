              Nestled deep in the woods of Pelham Bay Park and only a mile from a 
              network of bustling highways in the Bronx, the <mark>Bartow-Pell Mansion 
              Museum</mark> is a rare example of country elegance in New York City. The 
              Greek Revival house, originally occupied by publisher Robert Bartow 
              and family in 1842, sits on an estate that dates back to 1654 when 
              Thomas Pell, an English doctor from Connecticut, bought the land from 
              the Siwanoy Indians. The property was acquired by the City in 1888, 
              and the mansion was used by Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia as a summer office 
              in 1936. It opened as a museum in 1946.

          <p class = 'infoEdgar'>
            The <mark>tiny Poe cottage</mark> in the Bronx, built by John Wheeler in 1812, was the 
            last home of Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849), the great American poet and 
            author. Set in a small park on the Grand Concourse, it is the only house 
            left from the old village of Fordham. Poe leased the one-and-a-half-story 
            cottage for $100 a year and wrote many of his classic works there including 
            "The Bells," "Eureka" and "Annabel Lee." The cottage, saved from destruction 
            in the 1890s by the Shakespeare Society and moved from its original location 
            on the other side of Kingsbridge Road in 1913, preserves a precious chapter 
            of New York's literary heritage.
