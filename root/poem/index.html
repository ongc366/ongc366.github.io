                  As we balance the risks and rewards of the future
                  we are tempted with the need to prepare, especially
                  when the risks seem to outweigh the rewards.
                  From commercial avenues of prediction, like
                  having your palm read, to the daily observance of 
                  traditional superstition, like avoiding black cats, 
                  we strive to make sense of the future and prepare for the worst.
                  On the way, we then ask ourselves: if the
                  reward be so easily attained through preparedness and
                  when do we know if the reward can be ascertained or not?

                  Perhaps the answer lies not in asking questions
                  of when or if. Perhaps the answer may never reveal
                  itself. Instead what may be revealed to us is the reward
                  of an unseen future masked behind an image of 
                  an ordinary life&mdash;<em>coincidence</em>. An alternative to
                  real magic beyond prediction. A reward that is 
                  less of a question, but a random event that becomes clear and meaningful
                  with just a shift in perspective. It tells us in an almost otherworldly
                  way that participating in the journey may outweigh
                  the pressures we put in ensuring its end. Moreover
                  that the future cannot in fact be predicted, but 
                  appreciated. From this abstraction of the future we can
                  then find the poetry in our life and begin to
                  reap its rewards.
