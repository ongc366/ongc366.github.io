                  As we balance the risk and rewards of the future,
                  we are tempted with the need to prepare especially
                  when the percieved risks outweigh the rewards.
                  Such a need is satisfied either through commercial
                  avenues of prediction such as tarot card readings,
                  through a practice of traditional superstition,
                  or through guides which tell us how to be better
                  prepared to deal with the outcomes of risk. In
                  this process, we continually ask ourselves if the
                  reward be so easily attained through such modes
                  of preparedness? Moreover, when do we know if the
                  reward is ascertained or not?

                  Perhaps, the answer is revealed to us not in a
                  question of if or when. Maybe the answer is not
                  revealed to us at all. Instead, the rewards of a
                  life may come in the form of glimpses into the
                  future&mdash;random moments which almost seem fateful
                  and too impossible to comprehend. These
                  coincidences tell us in an almost otherworldly
                  way that participating in the journey outweighs
                  the pressures we put in ensuring its end. From
                  these abstractions of the future we can then
                  find the poetry in the ordinary of a life. Or,
                  more or less, push the boundaries of what we
                  ascertain as the impossible from the possible.
